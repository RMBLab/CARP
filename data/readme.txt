----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data that we used in our work is a public reliability dataset released in 
the following paper:

- Marin Silic, Goran Delac, and Sinisa Srbljic, "**Prediction of Atomic Web 
  Services Reliability Based on K-Means Clustering**," in Proc. of Joint Meeting 
  of the European Software Engineering Conference and the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium 
  on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE'13), pp. 289-299, 2013. 

The dataset provides the measured reliability data that was collected from 
distributed agents on the Amazon EC2 cloud. It is available for downloading at:

If you have any questions on the dataset, please contact the author **Dr. Marin 
Silic** from University of Zagreb. Thanks!
